# Data Structures and Algorithms 💻

> If you appreciate our work, please 🌟 this repository. It motivates us. 🚀🚀
</br>
This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms concepts and their implementation in several ways, programming questions and Interview questions. The main aim of this repository is to help students who are learning Data Structures and Algorithms or preparing for an interview. This contains questions from popular coding platforms including <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>, <a href ="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>, and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a>.

> If you’re practising on the coding platforms mentioned above also if you want to contribute, then you can add the questions in this repository.
