A **Heap** is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

|          | |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Max Heap | the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it‚Äôs children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. |
| Min Heap | the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it‚Äôs children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. |
